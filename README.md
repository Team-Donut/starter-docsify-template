# Quick start

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Initialize

If you want to write the documentation in the `./docs` subdirectory, you can use the `init` command.

```bash
docsify init ./docs
```

## Writing content

After the `init` is complete, you can see the file list in the `./docs` subdirectory.

* `index.html` as the entry file
* `README.md` as the home page
* `.nojekyll` prevents GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore

You can easily update the documentation in `./docs/README.md`, of course you can add [more pages](more-pages.md).

## Preview your site

Run the local server with `docsify serve`. You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
docsify serve docs
```
